# Wind-turbine-insights-and-intelligence-using-GGSA
Developed a solution for maintaining assets by spotting upcoming equipment failures, reducing maintenance costs by up to 24% and preventing unplanned outages by up to 49%.

The key objectives are
1. To generate service tickets automatically for the pre-failure events in the wind turbine by monitoring its state continuously.
2. To provide some visualizations to the customers so that they can draw some insights out of it.
3. To optimize repair cost and maintenance cost.
4. To provide a real-time platform to customers that enable them to make educated decisions about the asset.
5. To make the customer better understand their asset.
